# Chromebook Solutions
Chromebooks SUCK! We are all Windows Wannabees!
However, I have found a solution to Discord Statuses for Browser Users!
All Discord user statuses for Browser Discord users!
Discord on Cross-OS Linux is just to slow! But you want to show off or have a cool status on your profile!
Watching, Playing, Listening, or Streaming statuses can be on your profile, even if you aren't doing it.
Plus, be online 24/7 ---- Good for moderators or Server Owners so people can dm you


Download as zip, go to repl.it, and then upload all the files

- Warning, this is probably against Discord's ToS because it doesn't do malicious or bad things in any way, but Discord apparently does not like so-called "self-bots" even though this is not a selfbot script.

If you are going to modify this, then you are dumb because you will probably get banned forever so don't do it

If you end up getting into trouble, I am not liable in any way and it's not my responsibility because I just want to help Chromebook users such as myself because chromebooks are very limited and we can't do anything on a chromebook....Please do not use this in bad intent.

I am not responsible for any damage in any way; I will block off all communication related to this.
